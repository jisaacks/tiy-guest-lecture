# Backbone.Marionette.Region

Regions are responsible for showing and destroying views. They act as place holders for views to be injected into.

Regions allow you to break you application up into logical sections. They can also be nested for example, you may have 3 root regions such as *header*, *footer*, and *content*. Furthermore the *content* region may be broken into multiple subregions such as *main* and *sidebar*.
